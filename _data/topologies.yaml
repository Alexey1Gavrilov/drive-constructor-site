topology1:
  title: Drive train with just FC
  elements: ["pump", "motor", "cable", "converter", "grid"]
  applications: ["pumps"]
  text: > 
    This simple system topology can be used when it is possible
    to find a motor matching speed of the pump and when both, the
    motor and the frequency converter (FC), have similar voltage
    rating to that of the supply network (the grid). The FC provides
    full motor and pump controlability and protection. The switch is
    usually just manual connector, though in certain cases it can be a
    circuit braker.

topology2:
  title: Drive train with FC and transformer
  elements: ["pump", "motor", "cable", "converter", "trafo", "grid"]
  applications: ["pumps"]

    This system topology can be used when it is possible to find
    a motor matching speed of the pump and when both, the motor and
    the frequency converter (FC), have much lower voltage than voltage
    of the supply network and transformer is needed to match the
    voltages. The FC provides full motor and pump controlability and
    protection. The switch is usually just manual connector, though in
    certain cases it can be a circuit braker.

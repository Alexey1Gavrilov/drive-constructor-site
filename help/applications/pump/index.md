# Pump

Power on shaft of a pump can be calculated as
`
	P=(g * rho * h * eta)/(3.6 * 10^6)
`

where

`rho -`
- is density.

Parameters of the pump used in *Drive Constructor*:

* [Type](type.html)
* [Head](head.html)
* [Flow](flow.html)
* [Rated efficiency](ratedEfficiency.html)
* [Rated speed](ratedSpeed.html)
* [Pumped fluid](fluidDensity.html)
* [Starting torque as *T_rated](startingTorque.html)

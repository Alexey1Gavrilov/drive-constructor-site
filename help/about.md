# What is *Drive Constructor*?

*Drive Constructor* is free online software created to help building power conversion systems optimal for certain tasks. The task can be for example driving a mechanism, like pump or conveyor, by using electric power from the grid. Such a task requires conversion of the energy from electric into mechanical and the electric machine, being the "heart" of the power conversion system, works as a motor. Another example of a task can be delivering power extracted from the water flow by a tidal turbine into the grid; here conversion is from mechanical energy into electric one and the electric machine works as a generator. Providers of the equipment often call the tasks *Applications*.

The system between the mechanism and the grid can include various equipment; both electrical, such as frequency converters and transformers, and mechanical, such as gearboxes. The equipment, put together into the power conversion system, can be called a *drive train* or a *drive system* (this is by the why this online software is called *Drive Constructor*!) 

Navigating through the *Help* section of this website you can take a look at the selection of [applications](applications/overview.html), learn about what we mean by ["optimal systems"](applications/overview.html), see the list of [equipment](equipment/equipment.html) which you can choose to build your own systems and read about [algorithms](algorithms/algorithms.html) used in *Drive Constructor* for automatic selection of the components for your system. 

### Discover the complexity and versatility of the systems build from standard components!

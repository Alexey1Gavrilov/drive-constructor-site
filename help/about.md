# Discover the complexity and versatility of the systems build from standard components!

*Drive Constructor* is free online software created to help building power conversion systems optimal for certain tasks. The task can be for example driving a mechanism, like pump or conveyor, by using electric power from the grid. Such a task requires conversion of the energy from electric into mechanical and the electric machine, being the a "*heart*" of power conversion system, works as a motor. Another example of a task can be delivering power extracted from the water flow by a tidal turbine inoto the grid. Here conversion is from mechanical energy into electric one and the electric machine works as a generator. The system between the mechanism and the grid can include various equipment; both electrical, such as frequency converters and transformers, and mechanical, such as gearboxes. Providers of the equipment often call the tasks - *Applications*.

You can take a look at the selection of applications [here](applications/overview.html) and learn about what we mean by "optimal systems" [here](applications/overview.html). The list of equipment which you can choose from to build your own systems can be found [here](applications/overview.html). If you are interested you can also read about algorithms used in *Drive Constructor* for automatic selection of the components for your system.
